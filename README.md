>WARNING: I HAVE NOT UPDATED THIS PROJECT IN QUITE A WHILE AND FRANKLY I DOUBT I EVER WILL. ADOBE HAS DONE A VERY POORT JOB AT ADVANCING, PROMOTING, SUPPORTING AND BELIEVING IN THE FLASH/AIR PLATFORM. SO MUCH SO THAT, EVEN DIE HARD FANS LIKE ME, DECIDED TO MOVE ON. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN TAKING OVER THE PROJECT, PLEASE FORK IT AND HAVE FUN!
